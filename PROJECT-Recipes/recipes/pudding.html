    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Easy-to-make homemade chocolate pudding.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups whole milk, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1 - Combine 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk or
        stir with a fork until smooth and all lumps have been incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2 - Combine remaining milk with sugar in a medium saucepan over low
        heat. Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, whisking as needed
        to prevent lumps from forming, until mixture begins to thicken, 8 to 10
        minutes. Add chocolate chips and salt. Continue stirring until chips are
        completely melted and pudding is smooth and thickened, about 7 minutes
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3 - Pour pudding into 1 large bowl or 6 individual bowls. Place
        plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to prevent a skin from
        forming; smooth it gently against the surface. Refrigerate for at least
        3 to 4 hours before serving.
